# Hepatitis-C-in-Young-PWID

Code for hepatitis C in young persons who inject drugs (PWID). This is the source code for an in progress article:

A Dynamic Modeling Approach using State-Level Public Health Surveillance Data to Understand Transmission of Hepatitis C in Young Persons who Inject Drugs in Michigan, 2000-2013. Rachel E. Gicquelais, Joseph R. Coyle, Betsy Foxman, and Marisa C. Eisenberg. In prep. 

Questions? Contact Marisa Eisenberg (marisae@umich.edu) and Rachel Gicquelais (rgic@umich.edu).

The code given here simulates a model of hepatitis C transmission fit to hepatitis C surveillance data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services during 2000-2013 among PWID aged 15-30 years. To run, start with HCV_MS_0420.2017.m.

The Matlab code generates some basic plots for an initial look at the results. We have also provided an R script called HCV Figures_AJE.R to recreate plots from the paper referenced above.

Please cite the paper referenced above if you use our code or adapt it for your project.

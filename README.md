# Hepatitis-C-in-Young-PWID

Code for hepatitis C in young persons who inject drugs (PWID). This is the source code for an in progress article:

Gicquelais RE, Foxman B, Coyle J, Eisenberg MC.(2019). Hepatitis C transmission in young people who inject drugs: insights using a dynamic model informed by state public health surveillance. Epidemics. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2019.02.003

The code given here simulates a model of hepatitis C transmission fit to hepatitis C surveillance data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services during 2000-2016 among PWID aged 15-29 years. To run, start with HCV_MS_11152018.m.

The Matlab code generates some basic plots for an initial look at the results. We have also provided a R scripts called HCV Figures_11152018.R and HCV Intervention Figures_11152018.R to recreate plots from the paper referenced above.

Please cite the paper referenced above if you use our code or adapt it for your project.
